<p> Hey everybody! So I have created this portal for us to join one another so we can help others and make them happy. I hope you find
the whole experience satisfying. It's just a way to give back to the society. 
Besides this, I am like any other person you have met. I love to eat, travel, meet new people and work on exciting things. 
If you hear about any issue we can all work together, you know what to do. So happy screaming for now!! </p>
